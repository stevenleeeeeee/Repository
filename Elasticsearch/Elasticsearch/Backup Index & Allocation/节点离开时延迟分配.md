# With delayed allocation enabled, the above scenario changes to look like this:
# Node 5 loses network connectivity.
# The master promotes a replica shard to primary for each primary that was on Node 5.
# The master logs a message that allocation of unassigned shards has been delayed, and for how long.
# The cluster remains yellow because there are unassigned replica shards.
# Node 5 returns after a few minutes, before the timeout expires.
# The missing replicas are re-allocated to Node 5 (and sync-flushed shards recover almost immediately).
