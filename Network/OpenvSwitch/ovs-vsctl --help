  create TBL COL[:KEY]=VALUE  create and initialize new record
  destroy TBL REC             delete RECord from TBL
  wait-until TBL REC [COL[:KEY]=VALUE]  wait until condition is true
Potentially unsafe database commands require --force option.

Options:
  --db=DATABASE               connect to DATABASE
                              (default: unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock)
  --no-wait                   do not wait for ovs-vswitchd to reconfigure
  --retry                     keep trying to connect to server forever
  -t, --timeout=SECS          wait at most SECS seconds for ovs-vswitchd
  --dry-run                   do not commit changes to database
  --oneline                   print exactly one line of output per command

Logging options:
  -vSPEC, --verbose=SPEC   set logging levels
  -v, --verbose            set maximum verbosity level
  --log-file[=FILE]        enable logging to specified FILE
                           (default: /var/log/openvswitch/ovs-vsctl.log)
